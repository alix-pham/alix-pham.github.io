> Walk-through on how I made this website

Installation
* [install git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
* [install hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

Set up repo for Github Page
* [follow these instructions](https://pages.github.com/)

Create Hugo site and download theme
* create new Hugo site by running `hugo new site <<your repo name>> --force` with the name of the Github Pages repo you downloaded
* download a theme, for example the [poison](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/poison/) theme
    1. if you know you won't change the theme: use `git clone <<theme-url>> /themes/<<theme name>>`
    2. if you will make changes: fork the theme GitHub repo, then: `git submodule add <<forked-theme-url>> themes/<<theme-name>>`


Add content and test locally
* modify config.toml and .md files in website directory
    * a combination of theme instructions + [hugo instructions](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) should help you find where to add/modify your pages
* run ```hugo server``` in root directory (quit using Ctrl+C)
* see locally hosted website at http://localhost:1313/

How to modify the theme (you will need to have used option 2!)
* go to `themes/<<your theme>>`
    * `cd themes/<<your theme>>`
* make your modifications
* then update 
    * `git add .`
    * `git commit -m "<<message>>"`
    * `git push origin master` (or main)
* if there is a branch error, do that first, and then update:
    * `git stash`
    * `git checkout master` (or main)
    * `git stash pop`

Set up Github Actions to automatically build Hugo website
* [follow these instructions](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/blogging-with-hugo-and-github-pages/04-continuous-deployment/index.html)

Git commands
* `git add .`
* `git commit -m "<<message>>"`
* `git push origin main`
