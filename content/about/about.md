Originally from **Toulouse, France**, I currently live in **Lausanne, Switzerland**.

I am Assistant Director at **Effective Altruism Switzerland**, a non-profit building the community of effective altruists in Switzerland by organizing social and educational events, supporting individuals and groups, providing seminars and career programs, etc.

#### I am interested in[^\*]:
* **alternative proteins:** meat, eggs, and dairy products not made from living animals---cheap, tasty, and healthy alternatives can decrease animal product consumption, thus farmed animal suffering and the negative environmental impact of agriculture
* **resilient foods:** foods, food production methods or interventions that would allow for significant food availability in the face of a global catastrophic food shock
* **biosecurity and biosafety:** managing risks from biological agents and their products
* **policy:** governments are very powerful, and control significant proportions of world GDP; helping policy-makers can be a high-value strategy

#### Projects I undertook:
* **Effective Altruism:** Effective Altruism local chapter in Lausanne; community-building, speaker events, debates, etc.
